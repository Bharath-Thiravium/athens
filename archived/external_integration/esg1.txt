Absolutely—here’s a clean, fully elaborated **ESG implementation blueprint** you can plug into your existing React + Django stack. It focuses purely on **requirements, modules, process flows, menus, and functions** (with wind/solar emphasis and India-ready compliance). No tech duplication—just what to build.

* **Role Matrix:** ESG Admin, Compliance Manager, HSE Manager, Site Lead, Supervisor, Worker/Contractor, Auditor (internal/external), Stakeholder Relations.
* **Workflow Engine:** States: *Draft → Submitted → Reviewed → Approved/Rejected → Implemented → Verified → Closed.*
* **Evidence Management:** Photos, files, geo-tag, timestamps, digital signatures.
* **Compliance Calendar:** Licences/consents due dates (CPCB/SPCB consents, EPR, HWM, e-waste, batteries, water, air).
* **Thresholds & Alerts:** Configurable KPI limits → email/SMS/WS alerts.
* **Data Retention:** 7+ years, WORM (write-once logs) for legal defensibility.
